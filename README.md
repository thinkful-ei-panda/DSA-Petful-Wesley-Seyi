# About
At Petful, we believe every pet deserves a home

We match pets and people on a first-in first-out basis.

Put your name in the queue, and when it's your turn, come back 
      and choose whether you want the next available dog,
        cat, or both!

# Client-side Application

We deployed this using Zeit/now.sh.
The tech used was React, HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript.

The app utilizes asynchronous calls to a Heroku server that responds with data. 
By working on this project, you can learn how to set API calls to state, and utilize that state asynchronously to provide content.
We utilized a queue data structure to store the cat and dog information, so further developing this app can be a great help to learning data structures.
